# Line-follower-Obstacle-follower-and-Obstacle-avoider-
Sensor guided robot

The first robot will be a line follower which is programmed to follow a line. This robot detects the path using infra-red sensors which work on the principle of reflection of light. Using the same sensors, you will also develop robots that can avoid/follow obstacles or light.

Software requirement: Keil IDE, windows.


Hardware: 
Robotics Development Board 8052 microcontroller
USB-ASP Programmer Cable
IR Sensors - 2 Nos.
DC motors - 2 Nos.
Wheels for Motors - 2 Nos.
Castor Wheels - 1 No.
Chassis - 1 No.
U Clamps - 2 Nos.
Wire stripper
Screwdriver - 2 Nos.
Battery (6F22 9V)


How to execute this projects: first install keil software in your windows computer, then copy each folder in example directory of keil IDE.

Burn .hex file into 8052 microcontroller using USB - ASP programmer cable then reset your board and test your code.
